Gas Concentration Calculator - Functional Specifications
====================================================

1. Project Overview
------------------
The Gas Concentration Calculator is a web application that visualizes the concentration of a gas in a confined space over time. It considers the space volume, gas input flow rate, and ventilation rate to calculate and display the gas concentration evolution.

2. Mathematical Model
--------------------
2.1 Core Equations
- The concentration change is modeled using mass balance principles
- dC/dt = (Qin/V) - (Qout*C/V)
  where:
  C = Concentration (ppm)
  t = Time (minutes)
  Qin = Input flow rate (L/min)
  Qout = Ventilation rate (L/min)
  V = Space volume (m³)

2.2 Assumptions
- Perfect mixing of gas in the space
- Constant temperature and pressure
- Initial concentration is zero
- No chemical reactions or absorption
- Steady input and ventilation rates

2.3 Units and Conversions
- Space volume: cubic meters (m³)
- Flow rates: liters per minute (L/min)
- Concentration: parts per million (ppm)
- Time: minutes
- Flow rate conversion: 1 m³ = 1000 L

3. User Interface Requirements
----------------------------
3.1 Input Fields
- Space volume (m³)
- Gas input flow rate (L/min)
- Ventilation rate (L/min)
- Time interval selection (fixed at 5 minutes)
- Simulation duration (up to 6 hours)

3.2 Output Display
- Interactive graph showing:
  * X-axis: Time (minutes)
  * Y-axis: Concentration (ppm)
- Real-time calculation updates
- Clear visualization of concentration changes

4. Functional Requirements
-------------------------
4.1 Core Functions
- Input validation for all user entries
- Calculation of concentration at 5-minute intervals
- Dynamic graph generation and updates
- Error handling and user feedback

4.2 Data Processing

- Update graph in real-time

4.3 Validation Rules
- All input values must be positive numbers
- Volume must be > 0 m³
- Flow rates must be ≥ 0 L/min
- Maximum simulation time: 6 hours (360 minutes)

5. Technical Specifications
-------------------------
5.1 Technologies
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- Graphing: Chart.js or similar library
- No backend required (client-side calculations)

5.2 Performance Requirements
- Calculations completed within 1 second
- Smooth graph updates
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

5.3 Browser Compatibility
- Support for modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile-responsive design

6. Future Considerations
-----------------------
- Additional gas types
- Variable flow rates
- Temperature and pressure effects
- Multiple gas sources
- Export data functionality
- Save/load simulation scenarios
